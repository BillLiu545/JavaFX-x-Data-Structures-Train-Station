# JavaFX-x-Data-Structures-Train-Station
This repository contains a project that integrates JavaFX and data structures to simulate a train station schedule. The Data structure used for this project is the queue.

# How does it work?
Each train arrives at the station in the form of a queue. JavaFX displays the timetable for trains that are slated for departure at a certain time. A new train is added to the queue using the "New Arrival" button. Departure of trains can be simulated when a train is removed from the queue by clicking "New Departure".
